- 👀 I’m interested in learning:
    - OOP languages such as Java, C/C++, etc 
    - Android with Android Studio or other software
    - Unity to create 3D and VR :)
    - networking
    - AI and Cyber Security
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Java, HTML, CSS, basic networking and basic DBMS
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on learning different programming languages, Android, to create 3D and VR models, and open to learn about networking, AI and Cyber Security

Still at the beginning so I really need some help in choosing the right "path" :)
